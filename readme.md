# JavaScript30

Having completed the General Assemnly Software Engineering Immersive course I wanted to first start by refreshing my JavaScript knowledge.
I had already completed the "Learn JavaScript" course on Codecademy (prior to GA) and wanting to learn from as many sources as possible I opted to complete Wes Bos' [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) as opposed to just rewatching the lectures and and going back over the exercises from GA.
